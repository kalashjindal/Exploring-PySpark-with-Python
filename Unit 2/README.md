### 🔹 Part 2: 📊 Data Processing with PySpark (10 hours)

🔹 🏊 **Diving into Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)** (2 hours)
  - Get to know RDDs, the core data structure in Spark. Understand how it handles data across multiple nodes.
  - Learn how to create RDDs from data in memory or data stored in external storage systems.
  - Practice manipulating data in RDDs. You'll see how Spark's lazy evaluation works and why it's so useful.

🔹 🎭 **Transformations and Actions on RDDs** (2.5 hours)
  - Understand the difference between transformations, which create a new RDD, and actions, which return a result to the driver program or write data to an external storage system.
  - Practice using common transformations like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduceByKey()`.
  - Learn how to use actions to collect data or calculate aggregate values.

🔹 🗄️ **Working with DataFrames and PySpark SQL API** (3 hours)
  - Get to know DataFrames, a more structured way to handle data in Spark.
  - Learn how to create DataFrames from various data sources and how to perform operations on DataFrames.
  - Explore the PySpark SQL API, which lets you query DataFrames using SQL syntax.
  - Get hands-on experience manipulating data and running SQL queries on DataFrames.

🔹 🔄 **Handling Different Data Formats** (2 hours)
  - Learn how to work with different data formats in PySpark, including JSON, CSV, and Parquet.
  - Practice loading data from different formats into RDDs or DataFrames.
  - Learn how to convert and save your data back into these formats.

🔹 🎯 **Project 2: Processing and Transforming a Large Dataset with PySpark** (0.5 hours)
  - Use everything you've learned to process a real-world dataset. You'll load data, perform transformations, and run queries to gain insights.

🔹 💬 **Wrap Up and Q&A** (1 hour)
  - Review the key points from this part, and discuss any questions you have.
  - Reflect on what you've learned and how you'll use these skills moving forward.
  - Look ahead to Part 3 of the course, where you'll learn more about data cleaning and transformation techniques.
